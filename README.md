# TextMark
With TextMark you can mark words and sections in texts dynamically. Currently,
the entire text is tokenized and each word is assigned to a class. You can
then add, remove and toggle more classes of a specific word.
## Quick Start
First, create a TextMark object with a container for the text and the text
itself:
```javascript
var textMark = new TextMark(textContainer, text)
```
